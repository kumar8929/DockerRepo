#Networking (15% of exam)
● Network Driver Types
	Bridge
		• Simple to understand, use and troubleshoot, and is the default on stand-alone Docker hosts.
		• Consists of a private network that is internal to the host system; all containers implemented on this host using Bridge networking can communicate.
		• External access is granted by port exposure of the container’s services and accessed by the host OR static routes added with the host as the gateway for that network.
	None
		• Used when the container(s) in question need absolutely no networking access at all.
		• Containers operating on this driver can only be accessed on the host they are running on.
		• These containers can be attached directly (using ‘docker attach [containerid]’) or executing by another command on the running container (using ‘docker exec -it [containerid] [command]).
		• Not commonly used.
	Host
		• Sometimes referred to as ‘Host Only Networking’.
		• Only accessible via the underlying host.
		• Access to services can only be provided by exposing container service ports to the host system.
	Overlay
		• Allows communication among all Docker Daemons that are participating in a Swarm.
		• It is a ‘Swarm Scope’ driver in that it extends itself (building previously non-existent networks on Workers if needed) to all daemons in the Swarm cluster.
		• Allows the communication of multiple services that may have replicas running on any number of Workers in the Swarm, regardless of their origination or destination.
		• Default mode of Swarm communication.
	Ingress
		• Special overlay network that load balances network traffic amongst a given service’s working nodes.
		• Maintains a list of all IP addresses from nodes that participate in that service (using the IPVS module) and when a request comes in, routes to one of them for the indicated service.
		• Provides the ‘routing mesh’ that allows services to be exposed to the external network without having a replica running on every node in the Swarm.
	Docker Gateway Bridge
		• Special bridge network that allows overlay networks (including Ingress) access to an individual Docker daemon’s physical network.
		• Every container run within a service is connected to the local Docker daemon’s host network.
		• Automatically created when a Swarm is initialized or joined.
	macvlan: 
		Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network. The Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses. Using the macvlan driver is sometimes the best choice when dealing with legacy applications that expect to be directly connected to the physical network, rather than routed through the Docker host’s network stack. 
● Create a Docker bridge network for a developer to use for their containers
		#List out network
			docker network ls
		#Create a docker network
			docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.250 --opt "com.docker.network.driver.mtu"="1501" my_bridge 
		#To view more detail about the network 
			docker network inspect my_bridge
		# will be running on default bridge network
			docker run -d --name testweb -p 80:80 httpd
		#Get IP of the container
			docker container inspect --format="{{.NeteorkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}" testweb
		#Connect my running app to new bridge network, now the app will have two IPs
			docker network connect --ip=192.168.1.10 my_bridge testweb 
		#Disconnect the default network
			docker network disconnect bridge testweb
		#Add the service to new network
			 docker run -d --name testweb -p 80:80 --network my_bridge httpd
● Troubleshoot container and engine logs to understand a connectivity issue betweencontainers
	https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/
● Publish a port so that an application is accessible externally
	Docker level
		docker run -d --name=myweb -P nginx:latest #exposeing port to host machine based on expose which is mentioned in dockerfile
		docker run -d --name=myweb -p 8080:80 nginx:latest #bind to specific localport 8080
		docker run -d --name=myweb --publish 8080:80/udp nginx:latest #bind to specific localport 8080 only 80/UDP
		docker run -d --name=myweb -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80/udp nginx:latest #bind to specific local interface 127.0.0.1:8080 not other
	Docker Swarm
		docker service create --name my_web --replicas 3 --publish 8080:80 nginx
● Identify which IP and port a container is externally accessible on
	#List out the running containers
		docker ps
	#get the published port for service testweb
		docker port testweb
● Describe the different types and use cases for the built-in network drivers
	- Most commonly used built-in network drivers are bridge, overlay and macvlan
	- The bridge driver is a local scope driver, which means it only provides service discovery, IPAM, and connectivity on a single host. Multi-host service discovery requires an external solution that can map containers to their host location. This is exactly what makes the overlay driver so great.
	- MACVLAN use-cases may include:
		Very low-latency applications
		Network design that requires containers be on the same subnet as and using IPs as the external host network
● Understand the Container Network Model and how it interfaces with the Docker engine and network and IPAM drivers
	https://success.docker.com/article/networking
● Configure Docker to use external DNS
	- By default when starting a container it will be using host DNS
	- we can veryfy the same by checking resolve.conf file of container
	#Set a dns for container	
		docker run -d --name testweb --dns=8.8.8.8 --dns=8.8.4.4 httpd 
	Set a custom dns when a container start
		vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
			{
				"dns":["8.8.8.8","8.8.4.4"]
			}
		systemctl restart docker
● Use Docker to load balance HTTP/HTTPs traffic to an application (Configure L7 load balancing with Docker EE)
● Understand and describe the types of traffic that flow between the Docker engine, registry, and UCP controllers
	The traffic between DTR and UCP is always encrypted to ensure security. Traffic between containers is not encrypted by default. DTR / UCP management traffic used Mutual TLS
● Deploy a service on a Docker overlay network
	#Create an overlay network
		docker network create --driver=overlay --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.100 myoverlay0
	#view the details of network you created	
		docker network inspect myoverlay0
	#Create service on overlay network you created
		docker service create --name testweb -p 80:80 --network=myoverlay0 --replicas 3 httpd
● Describe the difference between "host" and "ingress" port publishing mode
	Two types of port publishing modes:
		• Host
			• Ports for containers are only available on the underlying host system and are NOT available for services outside of the host where that instance exists.
			• Used in single host environments or in environments where you need complete control over routing.
			• You are responsible for knowing where all instances are at all times, controlled with ‘mode=host’ in deployment.
		• Ingress
			• Since it is responsible for ‘routing mesh’, it makes all published ports available on all hosts (nodes or Workers) participating in the cluster so that the service is accessible from every node regardless of whether there is a service replica running on it at any given time.
NOTES:
	Containers can NOT be attached and detached from user-defined networks on the fly
