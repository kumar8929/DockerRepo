#Storage and Volumes
● State which graph driver should be used on which OS
	Linux distribution	Recommended storage drivers	Alternative drivers
		Docker Engine Community on Ubuntu - overlay2 or aufs (for Ubuntu 14.04 running on kernel 3.13)	overlay¹, devicemapper², zfs, vfs
		Docker Engine Community on Debian - overlay2 (Debian Stretch), aufs or devicemapper (older versions)	overlay¹, vfs
		Docker Engine Community on CentOS - overlay2	overlay¹, devicemapper², zfs, vfs
		Docker Engine Community on Fedora - overlay2	overlay¹, devicemapper², zfs, vfs

	Overlays usually work on common filesystem types such as EXT4 and XFS whereas snapshotting filesystems only run on volumes formatted for them.
● Demonstrate how to configure devicemapper
	sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
		{
			"storage-driver":"devicemapper"
		}
	service docker restart
	docker info | grep Storage #to verify
	NOTE: Make sure you had taken image backups, since when you change the storage driver you will lose all of your current images.
● Compare object storage to block storage, and explain which one is preferable when available
	File System Storage
	 - Each file is referenced by a filename, and typically has attributes associated with it. 
	 - Some of the more commonly used file systems include NFS and NTFS. 
	Block Storage
	 - block storage stores chunks of data in blocks.A block is identified only by its address.
	 - A block has no filename, nor does it have any metadata of its own. Blocks only become meaningful when they are combined with other blocks to form a complete piece of data.
	 - Block storage is commonly used for database applications because of its performance.
	 - Block storage is also generally used to provide snapshotting capabilities, which allow a volume to be rolled back to a specific point in time, without having to restore a backup.
	Object Storage
	 - Rather than referencing data by a block address or a file name, data is stored as an object and is referenced by an object ID.
	 - advantages of object storage are that it is massively scalable, and allows for a high degree of flexibility with regard to associating attributes with objects.
	 - disadvantage to using object storage is that it does not perform as well as block storage.Because object storage is designed primarily for scalability, it is a popular choice for public cloud providers.

● Summarize how an application is composed of layers and where those layers reside on the filesystem
	#Show the each layers of an image
		docker image history [OPTIONS] IMAGE
	Docker’s local storage area, which is usually /var/lib/docker/ on Linux hosts.
	To examine the layers of an docker image in the filesystem, list the contents of /var/lib/docker/<storage-driver>/layers/.
	The <missing> lines in the docker history output indicate that those layers were built on another system and are not available locally.
● Describe how volumes are used with Docker for persistent storage
	Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:
		Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
		You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
		Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
		Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
		Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.
	#Start a container with a volume
		docker run -d --name devtest --mount source=myvol2,target=/app  nginx:latest 
	#Use a read-only volume
		docker run -d --name=nginxtest --mount source=nginx-vol,destination=/usr/share/nginx/html,readonly nginx:latest
	#Start a service with volumes
		docker service create -d --replicas=4 --name devtest-service  --mount source=myvol2,target=/app nginx:latest
● Identify the steps you would take to clean up unused images on a filesystem, also on DTR
	you can use docker system prune to clean up multiple types of objects at once.
	#Prune images
		docker image prune
	#To remove all images which are not used by existing containers
		docker image prune -a
	#Use filter
		docker image prune -a --filter "until=24h"
	#Prune containers
		docker container prune
	#Remove stopped containers older than 24 hours
		docker container prune --filter "until=24h"
	#Prune volumes
		docker volume prune
	#Removes volumes which are not labelled with the keep label
		docker volume prune --filter "label!=keep"
	#Prune networks
		docker network prune
	#Prune everything
		docker system prune
	you are on Docker 17.06.1 or higher and want to also prune volumes, add the --volumes flag:
		docker system prune --volumes
	#DTR level
		Navigate to the Settings page, and choose Garbage collection.
		First you configure DTR to run a garbage collection job on a fixed schedule. At the scheduled time:
			DTR becomes read-only. Images can be pulled, but pushes are not allowed.
			DTR identifies and marks all unused image layers.
			DTR deletes the marked image layers.
		Select for how long the garbage collection job should run:
			Until done: Run the job until all unused image layers are deleted.
			For x minutes: Only run the garbage collection job for a maximum of x minutes at a time.
			Never: Never delete unused image layers.
